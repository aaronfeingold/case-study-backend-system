# Advanced Analysis Reports - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation ports the comprehensive data analysis and profit margin analysis from the original CSV-based discovery scripts (`discovery/data_analysis.py` and `discovery/profit_analysis.py`) into production-ready API endpoints that work with the live database.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Service Layer Extensions

**File:** `backend/api/app/services/report_service.py`

Added two new comprehensive report generation methods:

#### `generate_business_intelligence_report(params)`

- Generates multi-chart business intelligence analysis
- Creates 2 PNG files with 4 charts each (8 total visualizations)
- Analyzes sales performance, operational metrics, and customer insights
- Returns comprehensive financial and operational KPIs

**Charts Generated:**

- **Sales Analysis (File 1):**

  - Monthly revenue and profit trends
  - Revenue by product category
  - Profit margins by category (color-coded)
  - Product performance matrix (scatter plot)

- **Operational Insights (File 2):**
  - Revenue by sales territory
  - Top 20 customer value analysis
  - Seasonal sales pattern
  - Product category lifecycle

#### `generate_profit_margin_analysis(params)`

- Generates detailed profit margin and break-even analysis
- Creates 1 PNG file with 4 comprehensive charts
- Shows cost vs price relationships and break-even points
- Provides category-level profitability insights

**Charts Generated:**

- Raw material cost vs customer selling price (with break-even line)
- Profit margin by category (color-coded: red <20%, yellow <40%, green >=40%)
- Break-even analysis for top 15 products
- Cost structure breakdown (stacked bars showing cost % vs profit %)

### 2. API Routes

**File:** `backend/api/app/routes/reports.py`

Added 4 new admin-only endpoints:

1. **POST** `/api/reports/generate/business-intelligence`

   - Generates comprehensive BI report
   - Returns report ID, metrics, and file paths
   - Tracks report status in database

2. **POST** `/api/reports/generate/profit-margin`

   - Generates profit margin analysis
   - Returns detailed cost and margin metrics
   - Single high-resolution image output

3. **GET** `/api/reports/{report_id}/files`

   - Lists all files associated with a report
   - Useful for multi-file reports (like Business Intelligence)
   - Returns download URLs for each file

4. **GET** `/api/reports/{report_id}/download/{filename}`
   - Downloads specific file from multi-file report
   - Security checks to ensure file belongs to report
   - Returns PNG image file

### 3. Documentation

**File:** `backend/docs/ADVANCED_REPORTS_API.md`

Comprehensive API documentation including:

- Endpoint specifications
- Request/response examples
- Usage examples in curl, Python, and TypeScript
- Detailed description of chart outputs
- Error handling guidelines

### 4. Test Script

**File:** `backend/api/scripts/test_advanced_reports.py`

Automated test script that:

- Generates both report types
- Downloads all generated files
- Displays metrics and KPIs
- Lists all reports in the system
- Saves files to `downloaded_reports/` directory

## Key Features

### Database Integration

- Queries live PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy models
- Joins across multiple tables (invoices, line items, products, categories, etc.)
- Supports date range filtering
- Handles missing data gracefully

### High-Quality Visualizations

- 300 DPI PNG output for print-quality reports
- Professional color schemes
- Currency formatting for financial data
- Clear labels and legends
- Color-coded profit margins for quick insights

### Report Tracking

- All reports tracked in `reports` table
- Status tracking (pending, completed, failed)
- Stores parameters used for generation
- Saves metrics in database for quick access
- Links to generated file paths

### Security

- Admin-only endpoints (requires `@admin_required` decorator)
- JWT token authentication required
- File path validation to prevent directory traversal
- Timestamp-based file association verification

### Multi-File Support

- Business Intelligence report generates 2 related PNG files
- Files linked by timestamp (created within 60 seconds)
- `/files` endpoint lists all associated files
- Individual file download support

## Data Flow

1. Admin makes POST request to generate report
2. Service creates database record with "pending" status
3. Service queries database for relevant data
4. Pandas DataFrame created from SQL query results
5. Metrics calculated (revenue, profit, margins, etc.)
6. Matplotlib generates visualizations
7. PNG files saved to `/tmp/reports` (configurable)
8. Database record updated with "completed" status and metrics
9. Response sent to admin with report ID and download URLs
10. Admin retrieves files via download endpoints

## Comparison with Discovery Scripts

### Original Scripts (discovery/)

- Analyzed static Excel files
- Hardcoded file paths
- Generated markdown reports
- Manual execution
- Console output

### Production Implementation (backend/)

- Queries live database
- Configurable parameters
- RESTful API endpoints
- Admin-only access
- Database-tracked reports
- Downloadable PNG files
- JSON metrics response

## Usage Example

```bash
# Set your admin token
export ADMIN_TOKEN="your-jwt-token-here"

# Run the test script
cd backend/api
python scripts/test_advanced_reports.py

# Files will be downloaded to: downloaded_reports/
```

The script will:

1. Generate a Business Intelligence report
2. Generate a Profit Margin report
3. Download all files
4. Display metrics for both reports
5. List all reports in the system

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems

- Uses existing `Report` and `SavedReportTemplate` models
- Leverages existing authentication system (`@admin_required`)
- Integrates with existing `/api/reports` endpoints
- Follows established error handling patterns

### Database Models Used

- `Invoice` - Sales order header data
- `InvoiceLineItem` - Line item details
- `Product` - Product catalog
- `ProductCategory` - Category classifications
- `ProductSubCategory` - Subcategory details
- `Company` - Customer data
- `SalesTerritory` - Territory information

## Configuration

### Output Directory

Default: `/tmp/reports`

Can be configured when creating the ReportService:

```python
service = ReportService(db.session, output_dir='/custom/path')
```

### Date Filtering

Both report types support optional date range filters:

- `start_date` - Filter data from this date onwards
- `end_date` - Filter data up to this date

If omitted, all available data is analyzed.

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Data Validation**

   - Checks for empty result sets
   - Validates date parameters
   - Handles missing product costs gracefully

2. **File Operations**

   - Creates output directory if it doesn't exist
   - Handles file write errors
   - Validates file paths for security

3. **Database Errors**

   - Wraps operations in try/except blocks
   - Updates report status to 'failed' on errors
   - Stores error messages in database
   - Returns appropriate HTTP status codes

4. **Missing Data**
   - Fills NaN values for calculations
   - Provides default values for missing costs
   - Shows "No Data Available" messages in charts

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Queries**

   - Single comprehensive query with joins
   - Converts to Pandas DataFrame for analysis
   - Efficient aggregations using groupby

2. **Memory Usage**

   - DataFrame created in memory
   - Charts generated sequentially
   - Files written to disk and closed
   - Figures explicitly closed to free memory

3. **File Size**
   - High-resolution (300 DPI) but efficient PNG format
   - Typical file sizes: 500KB - 2MB per chart
   - No data duplication

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Async Generation**

   - Move report generation to background task
   - Return job ID immediately
   - Poll for completion status

2. **PDF Compilation**

   - Combine multiple PNG files into single PDF
   - Add executive summary text
   - Include data tables

3. **Email Delivery**

   - Email reports to admin
   - Scheduled report generation
   - Automatic distribution lists

4. **Custom Date Ranges**

   - Quarter-to-date
   - Year-to-date
   - Custom fiscal periods

5. **Interactive Dashboards**

   - Convert to interactive Plotly charts
   - Embed in frontend admin dashboard
   - Real-time filtering

6. **More Report Types**
   - Inventory analysis
   - Salesperson performance
   - Customer segmentation
   - Product lifecycle analysis

## Dependencies

The implementation uses:

- **pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy** - Numerical operations
- **matplotlib** - Chart generation
- **seaborn** - Enhanced visualizations (imported but available)
- **SQLAlchemy** - Database queries
- **Flask** - API framework

All dependencies already in the project's requirements.

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Ensure you have admin access
2. Obtain JWT token
3. Run test script: `python scripts/test_advanced_reports.py`
4. Check `downloaded_reports/` for generated files
5. Verify metrics in console output

Or use curl/Postman to test individual endpoints as shown in the API documentation.

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully ports the comprehensive data analysis capabilities from the discovery phase into production-ready, admin-only API endpoints. The reports provide deep insights into business performance, profitability, and cost structures, enabling data-driven decision making at the executive level.

All code follows the project's existing patterns, includes proper authentication and authorization, and is fully integrated with the database schema.
